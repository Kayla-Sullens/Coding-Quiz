# Coding Quiz JaveScript and Web APIs

## Description

This challenge assignment had a heavy focus on JaveScript and the DOM as we focused on Web APIs in this module. No starter code was given, so this was done from scratch. My biggest struggle with this assignment was deciding which approach I wanted to take, as my final version is the third version. I knew what I wanted to do and what this should look like, but there are so many possibilities I changed my mind a few times. Overall, it was a great learning process to go through the motions of creating something like this from scratch with very little outside support. I did get some troubleshooting help from my instructor, and I'd have no problem asking for some help on the job one day.
